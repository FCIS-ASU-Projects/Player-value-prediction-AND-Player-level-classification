# Player value prediction & level classification.
- Machine learning project that includes two different tasks.
   - First one was Regression proplem our mission is to predict the value of a football player based on some features.
   - Second one was Classification proplem, we used in it the same dataset but with different target column to classify player's level.
     
- Ridge Regression model was the best in Regression proplem with Test accuracy=0.965.
- XGBoost was the best model in classification proplem with Test accuracy = 0.9613.
